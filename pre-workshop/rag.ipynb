      "Based on the retrieved information from the FAQ database, it seems that the issue with the password authentication when connecting to the postgres port 5432 could be caused by different reasons depending on the error message received.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. If the error message indicates \"password authentication failed for user 'root'\", it might be because the port 5432 is being used by another postgres, or there could be a postgres service running on your computer. In this case, it is recommended to substitute port 5432 with a different port number that is not taken, such as 5431. Additionally, stopping the postgres service on your computer can potentially resolve the issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. If the error message states \"role 'root' does not exist\", this could also be caused by a local Postgres installation or other configuration issues. Changing the port number when creating the docker container, and then using that port for connecting to pgcli might help as a solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. If the error message mentions \"database 'ny_taxi' does not exist\", it could indicate that the specified database is not available. Checking if Postgres is running and ensuring the correct port is used for connection can help resolve this issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. If the error occurs while connecting via pgcli, it is recommended to use a different port and follow the provided steps accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the context provided, these suggestions should help address the issue you are facing with connecting to the postgres port 5432.\n"
